Readwise local plus will be a free, open source tool for managing and enhancing your
Readwise highlights.

The tool creates a local database mirror of your Readwise highlights
- giving you granular control of highlight syncing with your note-taking applications,
and allowing you to add additional data to your highlights.
E.g. screenshots of tweets, full podcast transcripts, etc.

Features in development
-----------------------

- Full control of syncing with your note-taking applications
   - Book notes to Obsidian? Article highlights to Roam Daily Note? No problem!
- Automatic enhancement for your notes
   - Worried about relying on X post links? Automatically screenshot tweets, add them to
     your local storage, and update your notes with the local image. Easy.
   - Want a full podcast transcript in your notes? Automatically download and store
     transcripts for your podcast highlights. (Requires a local installation of Whisper).
- API for writing custom workflows
   - A standardised(ish, hopefully) and easily extensible (ha!) interface for
     interacting with note application APIs.

.. important::
   - A Readwise account and subscription is required to use tool.
   - Readwise Local Plus is not affiliated with Readwise LLC in any way.
     It is an independent project that enhances the Readwise experience by providing
     local storage and, hopefully useful, additional power user features.
   - I'm a huge Readwise fan and long time user, and I built this for myself.
